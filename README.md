CSGO External hack written in C# for griefing.

### Information
This is not a hack in the typical sense.  It is not intended to dominate opponents, but to grief teammates.  So far, there is nothing in it except a blockbot and Entity and LocalPlayer classes.

### TODO
- Runboost bot.
- Door spammer.
- ClanTag changer.
- UserCMD class.
